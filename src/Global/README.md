# Global Folder

This folder will contain codes for Global Components.
Nothing else should be here.

### Structure

This not the actual structure.. This is how the structure must be followed in this particular folder.

This is just an **Example**.

    .
    └── Button
    |   ├── Button.tsx          # Having JSX Elements
    |   └── Button.styles.ts   # Styles for JSX Elements
    |
    |...
